ncdu 1.13
=========

DESCRIPTION

  ncdu (NCurses Disk Usage) is a curses-based version of
  the well-known 'du', and provides a fast way to see what
  directories are using your disk space.


REQUIREMENTS

  In order to compile and install ncdu, you need to have
  at least...

  - a POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, BSD, etc)
  - curses libraries and header files


INSTALL

  The usual:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

  If you're building directly from the git repository, make sure you have perl
  (or rather, pod2man), pkg-config and GNU autoconf/automake installed, then
  run 'autoreconf -i', and you're ready to continue with the usual ./configure
  and make route.
